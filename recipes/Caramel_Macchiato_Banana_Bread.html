  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Baking banana bread is one of my favorites, and I love nothing more than
    enjoying a slice with a nice cup of coffee. This was the inspiration for
    my recipe, which features a coffee infused loaf and a rich caramel glaze.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>

    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>

    <li>2 large very ripe bananas</li>

    <li>
      ½ cup caramel macchiato flavored liquid coffee creamer (such as
      International Delight®)
    </li>

    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>

    <li>2 eggs</li>

    <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee granules</li>

    <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

    <li>6 tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan
      with cooking spray. In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking
      powder, cinnamon, and salt.
    </li>

    <li>
      In a large mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until almost
      smooth, and stir in the coffee creamer, vegetable oil, eggs, sugar, and
      instant coffee granules until the coffee granules have dissolved.
      Gradually stir in the flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, until
      batter is almost smooth, and pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the
      banana bread comes out clean, about 1 hour. Allow to cool before
      removing from pan.
    </li>

    <li>
      Melt the unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and mix in the
      brown sugar and vanilla extract. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring
      to dissolve sugar, and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer the syrup for 3
      minutes, allow to cool to a warm but liquid temperature, and pour the
      glaze over the banana bread. Serve when glaze has set.
    </li>
  </ol>

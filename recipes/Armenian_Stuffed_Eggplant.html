  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Served as an easy vegetarian side dish or entree, this eggplant will
    delight even the most picky eater. The eggplant becomes tender in the oven
    and absorbs the flavors of tomato, onion, and bell pepper for a wonderful
    Middle Eastern dish. I made this dish for Thanksgiving; it was a big hit
    with my Armenian grandmother! Serve with sides of tabuli salad, hummus,
    and a whole wheat pita. I hope you enjoy this taste of Armenia from my
    family to yours!

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large eggplants</li>

    <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>

    <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch strips</li>

    <li>½ onion, sliced</li>

    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>

    <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce with no salt added</li>

    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>

    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

    <li>1 pinch chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>

    <li>
      Cut eggplants in 1/2, then cut each 1/2 into thirds, leaving 12 eggplant
      spears total. Place on a baking sheet and brush with 2 tablespoons olive
      oil.
    </li>

    <li>
      Roast in the preheated oven until fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce
      the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </li>

    <li>
      While eggplants are cooking, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over
      medium heat in a medium to large pan. Add bell pepper, onion, and garlic
      to the hot pan and cook until onions become tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir
      in tomatoes and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3
      minutes. Set aside to cool.
    </li>

    <li>
      Remove eggplants from the oven and let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.
      Transfer eggplants to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Slice each spear
      vertically using a fork and knife, being careful not to cut through
      skin. Pry each open and fill with 2 to 3 tablespoons of tomato filling.
      Cover with tomato sauce.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 30 minutes. Season with
      salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley.
    </li>
  </ol>
